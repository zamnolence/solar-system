<h1>The Planets</h1>
<p>
  Mercury, a rocky planet, is a terrestrial planet that 
  spins slowly on its axis.  It is the smallest and closest 
  planet to the Sun but not the hottest planet in the Solar 
  System. Mercury's thin atmosphere is composed of oxygen, 
  sodium, helium, hydrogen, and potassium, which is unbreathable.
</p>
<p>
  Venus, the terrestrial planet, is the 2nd closest planet to the 
  sun. It spins slowly in the opposite direction. Its structure 
  and size are similar to Earth. The atmosphere of Venus is known 
  to be dense and toxic, which makes Venus the hottest planet in 
  the Solar System.
</p>
<p>
  Earth, a rocky terrestrial planet, is the 3rd solar planet from 
  the sun. It is only the planet having an atmosphere containing 
  free oxygen, oceans of water, which is perfect place for life! 
  Earth completes one spin for 24 hours. 
</p>
<p>
  Mars, the Red Planet, is the 4th planet from the Sun. Mars is one 
  of the most explored planets in the Solar System in the belief 
  that the planet is potentially habitable due to many reasons: 
  Its surface consists of water and oxygen, the temperature is not 
  too hot or too cold, there is enough sunlight, and the gravity 
  is sufficient for human body to adapt to.  However,  it is still a
   tough place for life as the atmosphere is made up of carbon 
   dioxide, argon, nitrogen.
</p>
<p>
  Jupiter, a gas giant planet, is the 5th planet from the sun and the 
  largest in the Solar system. Jupiter's Great Red Spot is a gigantic 
  torm thatâ€™s about twice the size of Earth and has raged for over a 
  century. Its atmosphere is made mostly of helium and hydrogen, which 
  does not support life. 
</p>
<p>
  Saturn, a gas giant planet with ring system, is a 2nd-largest planet 
  and the 6th planet from the sun. Similarly to Jupiter, Saturn 
  atmosphere is made up of helium and hydrogen, while its rings are 
  made of moon dust, rocks and water ice. These conditions of Saturn 
  makes it a lifeless behemoth. 
</p>
<p>
  Uranus, the ringed, icy gaseous giant planet, is the 7th planet 
  from the sun. Like Venus, Uranus rotates in the opposite direction 
  to other planets. But Uranus is unique in that it rotates on its 
  side! Uranus's atmosphere is made up of hydrogen and helium, with 
  a small amount of methane, which cannot support life.
</p>
<p>
  Neptune, a blue ice giant planet, is the 8th planet from the sun 
  and the 4th-lagest planet. Like Uranus, its atmosphere is made up 
  of hydrogen and helium, with a small amount of methane. It is dark, 
  cold and vey windy.
